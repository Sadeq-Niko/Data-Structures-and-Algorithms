## Overview
This repository provides implementations of critical data structures and algorithms in Python.

## Implemented Codes
Below is a list of the current implementations in the repository:

1. **AVL Tree**:
   - A self-balancing binary search tree that ensures O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations by maintaining a balanced tree structure.

2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - An all-pairs shortest path algorithm that computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It uses dynamic programming to handle graphs with positive and negative edge weights efficiently.

3. **Levenshtein Distance**:
   - An algorithm for measuring the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into another. This implementation is crucial for applications in spell checking and approximate string matching.

4. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**:
   - Solves the problem of finding the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices, minimizing the total number of scalar multiplications. This is achieved using dynamic programming to break down the problem and compute the optimal solution.

5. **Minimum Edit Distance**:
   - A variation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm, often used in natural language processing tasks to find the edit distance between two sequences. It measures how similar two strings are by calculating the minimum edits needed to transform one string into the other.

6. **N-Queens Problem with Backtracking**:
   - An algorithm that places N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This implementation uses the backtracking technique, systematically exploring all possible placements and backtracking when a conflict is detected.
